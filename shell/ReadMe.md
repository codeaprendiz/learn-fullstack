# Shell

A bunch of shell scripts that I used once upon a time. Actually, it's very long ago. I don't even remember what they do.
Too attached to them to let them go.

It might be a good idea to convert them into tasks like other folders. Let's see when this get's done.
Humm okay.

Verily, I have come across a cluster of shell scripts from a bygone era. Alas, the mists of time have clouded my memory, and their purpose eludes me. Yet, so fondly do I cling to them that I cannot bear to part ways.

Pray, it may prove a prudent venture to transform these scripts into tasks akin to their brethren folders. Let us observe as this undertaking unfolds. Ah, indeed, such a thought doth arise.
